\theabstract{
In the last few years the capability of natural language processing has increased greatly. The implications this methodical leap has for different areas is yet to be explored. In this thesis, I have evaluated the predictive power of financial news headlines on the movement of financial indices. More specifically, I tried to determine if I could improve a traditional time series model by adding news data. In my experiments, I used text representations of different complexities, from TF-IDF to recent transformer models, such as BERT and Sentence-BERT and, as targets, the S\&P 500 and US treasury rates with one and three years maturity. 

My findings suggest that no model can predict the movement of treasury rates based on news data, but the classification performance for the S\&P 500 is well over a random baseline. The best model using the TF-IDF word representation and a random forest classifier could reach an accuracy of 59.1\%. 

Furthermore, adding news data can predict better than a random baseline whether a time series forecast is too high or too low. This applies to all indices. I could reach an accuracy of 64.1 \% with SBERT feature extraction and logistic regression.
